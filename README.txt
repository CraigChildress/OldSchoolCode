The code released here does not comprise a complete project.  It does 
represent a series of building blocks - working samples - of a classic
IBM/370 based data entry and inquiry system. 
The work was done on the Hercules system running the TK4- distribution
of MVS 3.8j. I have limited myself to using the IBM supplied tool chain,
for this initial stage, but future projects will also use VSAM-IO, 
C3370 and MAP3270. 

While COBOL-based, green screen data entry forms may not sound exciting in age of 
AWS and web-based servives, I find it somewhat fascinating to explore the capabilities,
and weaknesses, of the technology of that time. 

My professional deveoper background has been centered around IBM
System/38, AS/400 -to- IBMi. The contrast in the "family platforms" 
is quite significant, and the topic of disuccion over beers, I think.

The projects that may appear here are not particularly suited to anyone's
needs, and may serve no purpose other than to occupy my mind for a 
short time.  That said, feel free to peruse, use, critique what you see 
here.  Cheers!
